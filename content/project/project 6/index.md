This is the Media Club of Hanoi - Amsterdam High School. As a director of content, I provided overall leadership to the school's media initiatives, strategically planning and executing its annual programs, contents and calendar of activities. I also supervised 10-members working under the Content department of Ams Media.

As the Director of Content, I have create content about HN-Amsterdam School on the school's Facebook and TikTok platforms, attracting a lot of love and interaction from the students.

Additionally, I am the one directly responsible for coming up with ideas for club events such as designing a fundraising card game and selling "healing" kits, which include a booklet and a candle-making kit, as a way to help students relax and relieve stress. This has been a very special experience for me because I have been able to unleash my creativity in various aspects.
