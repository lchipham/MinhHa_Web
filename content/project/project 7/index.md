summary: GIANT - a student-led project focused on promoting gender equality and inclusivity - is the first project where I worked as Project Manager. I am leading a team of 6 members, managing and responsible for all project activities, plan, as well as project implementation progress. Although there were many difficulties and challenges that I encountered, they became valuable lessons for me to improve my leadership, management, planning and organization skills. During my time at GIANT, I successfully launched a campaign to raise awareness about gender bias on the FB platform and created content for a Self-Defense Workshop, engaging more than 500 secondary and high school students in Hanoi.
