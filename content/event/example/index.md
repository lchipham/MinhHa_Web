The (đàn tranh/đàn thập lục) is a plucked zither of Vietnam, based to the Chinese guzheng. The same root is also Japanese koto, the Korean gayageum and ajaeng, the Mongolian yatga, the Sundanese kacapi and the Kazakh jetigen. It has a long soundbox with the steel strings, movable bridges and tuning pegs positioned on its top (Wikipedia, 2023).
